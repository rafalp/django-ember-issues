# django-ember-issues
This repository is an tracker for documenting current state of Ember.js development in Django.

This list is maintained to record gotchas and differences in conventions and defaults between Ember.js/Data/Cli and Django/RestFramework, as well as existing/hoped solutions for those.

This is done in hopes that it will be useful to people developing for Django & Ember.js, as well as for those willing to maintain Ember addons bringing those two worlds together.

If you found undocumented problem, feel free to open issue here.
