# django-ember-issues
This repository is an tracker for documenting current state of Ember.js development in Django.

This list is maintained to record gotchas and differences in conventions and defaults between Ember.js/Data/Cli and Django/RestFramework, as well as existing/hoped solutions for those.

This is done in hopes that it will be useful to people developing for Django & Ember.js, as well as for those willing to maintain libraries bringing those two worlds closer to each other.

If you found undocumented problem, feel free to open issue here. Even better if you are willing to develop library solving one!
